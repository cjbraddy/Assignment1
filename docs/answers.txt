Branches are used so that development can occur without fear of the program
being corrupted by a change.
They are also used so that there can be better organization regarding separation
of development for different features.

(I) Inheritance is when a class "inherits" functions, variables, and properties
from a parent class.
(II) Polymorphism is when one can use the parent's reference variable to refer

The main difference between the integration manager workflow and the dictator
workflow is that in the dictator workflow, the developer's work is checked
by at least two other people before being committed to the central repository.

(j)
The dictator workflow would be beneficial for larger projects as the dictator 
does not have to sort through all submitted commits themselves, relying on 
lieutenants to assist. This provides a clearer view on what to merge with the
main branch.
